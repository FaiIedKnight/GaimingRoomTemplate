# GaimingRoomTemplate
Completed template for CS230 Class

  This project was to complete a design template for the client The Gaming Room. They are a gaiming company looking to design a game for various platforms. Using a template when starting to design a code really hleped me stay on track and focus on different aspects of this project individually. I feel like my evaluation section of this document could use some revision to make it easier to understand and so it can sound more professional. 
    One aspect of designing that I feel is really important is the user's needs. If a game is frustrating for a user to use, then in my experience users tecd to leave these games for other games that are smoother, so making the user experience as friendily and as smooth as possible should be one of a designer's top proorities if a  game is to succeed.
